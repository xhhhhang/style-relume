## folder structure generation
```
create a file to print the file structure of a folder into a markdown file to view easily, remember the root level (first level) should also be printed into the markdown. 

And by 'root', i mean if the command is 'python folder_structure.py folderA pathA', then the root should be 'folderA', and it should appears as the first level of printed folder structure.
